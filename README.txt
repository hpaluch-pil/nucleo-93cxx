An future attempt to directly read 93Cxx serial
FLASH using Nucleo ST32 board.


Board info at: https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki/Getting-started-with-ST-NUCLEO-F767ZI-Board

The GPIO_IOToggle/ is versioned as overlay (only changed files there)

You should copy files from the GPIO_IOToggle\
to extracted en.stm32cubef7.zip downloaded from
https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef7.html#sw-tools-scroll

Target directory is like:
STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.14.0\Projects\STM32F767ZI-Nucleo\Examples\GPIO\GPIO_IOToggle\
